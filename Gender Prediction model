Gender Prediction model 
Key Functions of the Project
1. Image Preprocessing: The project starts by preprocessing the input images. This involves resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and detecting faces to focus on relevant regions.
2. Face Detection: OpenCVâ€™s face detection algorithms are used to identify and isolate faces within the input images, ensuring that the model analyzes the correct parts of the image.
3. Feature Extraction: The project extracts significant features from the detected faces, which are essential for accurate gender prediction. These features might include facial structure, shape, and other distinguishing characteristics.
4. Gender Prediction: Using the extracted features, the machine learning model predicts the gender of the person in the image. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset to recognize patterns and characteristics associated with different genders.
5. Output: The predicted gender is then outputted, providing a quick and automated way to understand the gender distribution of the analyzed images.
Applications
1. Marketing: Helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies based on the gender distribution of their audience.
2. User Experience: Enhances user experience by personalizing content and services according to gender preferences.
3. Demographic Analysis: Assists in demographic studies by providing automated gender analysis of visual data.
